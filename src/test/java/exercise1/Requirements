Requirements for "Recent-list"

* When the program is run for the first time, the list is empty.

* When a file is opened, it is added to the recent file list.

* If an opened file already exists in the recent file list, it is bumped to the top, not duplicated in the list.

* If the recent file list gets full (typical number of items is 15), the oldest item is removed when a new item is added.
